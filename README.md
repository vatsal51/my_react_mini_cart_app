# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Hello, this is my Mini Cart App

A small app depicting a sample online store shopping cart with a feature to add/delete products to and from the cart.
On the first load, it fetches the data from the API provided

>With a click of the + and â€“ buttons, product quantity increases and decreases, respectively.
>With a click on the Cart icon, it can toggle to show and hide, respectively.
>With a click of the X button in the mini cart (in the header) the products can be removed from the cart. 
>All changes to the cart are stored in local storage.
